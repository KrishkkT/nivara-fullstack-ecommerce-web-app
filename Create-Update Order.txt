     POSTCreate Custom Order
     https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/orders/create/adhoc
     Use this API to create a quick custom order. Quick orders are the ones where we do not store the product details in the master catalogue.
     You have to pass all the required params at the minimum to create a quick custom order. You can add additional parameters as per your preference.
     Note:
* In case the 'shipping_is_billing' field is false, further shipping detail fields are required.
     If no channel id is passed, the order will be assigned to the default custom channel. If the channel id is not known, use the 'Get All Channels' API to get the list of all integrated channels in your Shiprocket account.
* order_id field cannot be equal to an already existing id. Doing so does not change or affect the existing order.
* New orders cannot be created with order id's same as that of cancelled orders. If error 422 shows up despite filling in the correct details, consider changing the order_id.
* Be sure to input the correct calculated sub_total amount. The total is not calculated automatically through the API.
* The 'order_id' returned in the response is the Shiprocket order_id. Please save this order ID as we will use this in future API calls.
